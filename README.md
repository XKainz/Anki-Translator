Anki-Translator is a Add-On for the flashcard program [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/).

This Add-On translates vocabularies for you. So if you want to add a new flashcard to your deck you can open this Add-On 
and let it find translations for you from the web.

After a click on 'Translate' the translations get loaded. You mark the checkboxes of the translations you want to have 
on your flashcard and leave the window with a click on 'OK'.

The chosen translations get copied on your flashcard.
