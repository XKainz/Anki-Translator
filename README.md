# Anki-Translator
######v1.0
Anki-Translator is a Add-On for the flashcard program [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/).

This Add-On translates vocabularies for you. So if you want to add a new flashcard to your deck you can open this Add-On 
and let it find translations for you from the web.

All the Translations come from [PONS](http://en.pons.com/).

## Usage

Just click this translate button in Anki's Editor. 

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jannewulf/Anki-Translator/dev/docs/translated-tree.png)

A new window opens where you choose the source and target languages and if you want grammar infos (like grammatical gender, etc.).

After you entered the vocable and clicked on 'Translate' the translations get loaded. You mark the checkboxes of the translations you want to have 
on your flashcard and leave the window with a click on 'OK'.

The chosen translations get copied on your flashcard.

## Installation
Download this project and copy the 'Translator.py' file and the 'TranslatorAddon' folder into your Anki Add-On directory.

This project will be published on the [Anki Add-Ons Website](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/) soon.
